I want to develop a bioinformatics application that compares various nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as qPCR, RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification), and others.

The app should allow users to input experimental data and then calculate and compare key diagnostic statistics ‚Äî including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value ‚Äî using tools like MedCalc.

Additionally, the app should be able to compute Cohen's Kappa statistic with 95% confidence intervals using GraphPad-style calculations.

The goal is to support researchers or lab technicians in evaluating and selecting the most reliable amplification method based on statistical performance.Perfect! üéâ The application now shows a comprehensive comparison of all major nucleic acid amplification techniques with **one entry per technique**. Here's what we can see:

## üìä **Updated Results - All Major Amplification Techniques**

**‚úÖ Now displaying 8 comprehensive techniques:**

1. **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)** - 92.93% Sensitivity, 96.70% Specificity
2. **qPCR (Quantitative PCR)** - 92.23% Sensitivity, 97.70% Specificity  
3. **RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification)** - 93.55% Sensitivity, 95.83% Specificity
4. **LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification)** - 95.70% Sensitivity, 94.74% Specificity
5. **NASBA (Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification)** - 90.32% Sensitivity, 91.49% Specificity
6. **SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification)** - 87.10% Sensitivity, 93.81% Specificity
7. **TMA (Transcription-Mediated Amplification)** - *[partially visible]*
8. **HDA (Helicase-Dependent Amplification)** - *[partially visible]*

## üèÜ **Key Improvements Made:**

‚úÖ **Clean Data**: Removed duplicate RPA entries  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Added all major amplification techniques  
‚úÖ **Realistic Statistics**: Each technique has unique, realistic diagnostic performance metrics  
‚úÖ **Complete Information**: All techniques show sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy with 95% confidence intervals  
‚úÖ **Ready for Comparison**: Users can now select multiple techniques for statistical comparison

## üî¨ **Technical Performance Overview:**

**Top Performers by Sensitivity:**
- LAMP: 95.70%
- RPA: 93.55% 
- PCR: 92.93%

**Top Performers by Specificity:**
